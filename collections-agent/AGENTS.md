# Collections Agent

AR collections management app. Monitor overdue customer accounts, use AI to assess risk and draft collection emails, record payments (auto-applied oldest-first), and track all changes in an audit log.

## How It Works

1. Dashboard shows total outstanding, AR aging breakdown, and priority customers
2. Worklist page ranks customers by AI risk score — one-click buttons to assess risk or draft email
3. `ca_assess_risk` automation analyzes invoices + payment history → returns risk score, level, recommended action
4. `ca_draft_email` automation picks the right tone (friendly/firm/urgent/final) based on overdue days, personalizes with invoice details
5. `ca_record_payment` automation applies payment oldest-first across invoices, auto-resolves customer when fully paid
6. Audit hooks on `ca_customers` and `ca_invoices` log all changes with before/after state

**Customer statuses:** `active` / `contacted` / `promised` / `escalated` / `resolved`

**Key external IDs:** `collections-agent:ca_assess_risk`, `collections-agent:ca_draft_email`, `collections-agent:ca_record_payment` (automations)

## Lumera Concepts

A Lumera app is built from these primitives — all defined as code in `platform/`:

- **Collections** (`platform/collections/*.json`) — Data tables with typed fields. Deployed via `lumera apply`.
- **Automations** (`platform/automations/*/`) — Python scripts that run on Lumera's servers. Each has a `config.json` and `run.py`.
- **Hooks** (`platform/hooks/*.js`) — JavaScript on collection lifecycle events (`before_create`, `after_update`, etc.).
- **Agents** (`platform/agents/*/`) — AI chat agents with a `config.json` and `system_prompt.md`.
- **Webhooks** — Receive events from external services (Stripe, GitHub, etc.). Events land in `lm_event_log`; process them with hooks or automations.
- **Mailbox** — Each tenant gets an email address. Inbound emails are persisted to `lm_mailbox_messages` — use hooks to trigger automations on new mail.
- **Email** — Send transactional emails from automations via `from lumera import email`. Logged to `lm_email_logs`.

All resources use **external IDs** in the format `<app-name>:<resource-name>` (auto-derived from `package.json` name + directory/file name).

## Architecture Files

- **architecture.md** — Technical reference for coding agents. Data models, schemas, relations, hook logic, automation flows, design decisions. An agent starting a new session should understand the full system from this file.
- **ARCHITECTURE.html** — Product brief for the user. This is NOT a system diagram — it's a visual pitch showing what the app will do from the user's perspective. Structure it as:
  1. **Hero**: App name, one-line value prop, who it's for.
  2. **Your workflow**: 3-5 step animated walkthrough of the main user journey (e.g. "Set up drivers → Generate forecasts → Compare scenarios → Share with board"). Each step gets a simple icon/illustration and a sentence. Use subtle CSS animations to reveal steps sequentially.
  3. **What you'll see**: Wireframe-style mockups of key screens (SVG rectangles with placeholder labels showing layout — sidebar, tables, charts, cards). Enough to convey the UX, not pixel-perfect.
  4. **Under the hood** (collapsed `<details>`): The technical system diagram for those who want it.
  
  Keep it clean and minimal. Finance person should look at it and say "yes, that's what I want" or "no, change X."

## Workflow

When the user describes what they want to build:

### Phase 1: Design
1. **Read skills first** — Read the matching skill files for API details and patterns.
2. **Design before code** — Write `architecture.md` (technical details) and `ARCHITECTURE.html` (visual product brief). Then **stop and ask the user to review ARCHITECTURE.html**. Iterate until satisfied.

### Phase 2: Interactive Prototype
3. **Build a clickable prototype** — Build every screen with mock data so the user can open the Preview tab and experience the real app. This means:
   - Create a `src/lib/mock-data.ts` file with realistic dummy data matching the domain (real account names, plausible numbers, 12+ months of data, multiple scenarios).
   - Build all routes and components using this mock data — dashboard, editors, tables, charts, detail views. Full navigation, real layouts, working interactions (tabs, filters, sorts, modals).
   - Add a small **status banner** on each page: a subtle top bar or badge showing `✅ Live in prototype` for features that are fully represented, and `🔜 Connects to backend` for actions that will work once collections and automations are deployed (e.g. "Save" buttons, "Run forecast" actions).
   - The prototype should feel like a finished app with frozen data — not a wireframe.
4. **Stop and ask for feedback** — Tell the user to open the **Preview tab** in Studio. The dev server starts automatically when they open it — you do NOT need to run `pnpm dev` or start any server yourself. Iterate on layout, columns, navigation, and flows until they approve.

### Phase 3: Build
5. **Build the backend** — Create collection schemas matching the mock data shapes, write automations and hooks, deploy with `lumera apply`, create a seed script with the mock data.
6. **Connect the frontend** — Replace mock data imports with API calls (`pbSql`, `pbList`, `createRun`). The layouts stay the same — only the data source changes.
7. **Code is source of truth** — Edit files in `platform/`, then deploy with `lumera apply`. Don't edit in the Lumera UI.
8. **Keep architecture current** — Update both architecture files after significant changes.
9. **Commit and push** — After completing each phase or making significant changes, commit and push: `git add -A && git commit -m "descriptive message" && git push`. The sandbox filesystem is ephemeral — uncommitted or unpushed work is lost if the sandbox is recycled.
10. **Deploy marker** — When your changes create or modify platform resources that need `lumera apply`, include at the very end of your response: `<!-- DEPLOY: short commit message -->`. Do NOT include for frontend-only changes.

## File Artifacts

When you create a file the user should **see** in chat (HTML pages, SVG graphics,
CSV exports, PDFs, images, charts, etc.), call `create_artifact` with the file path
after writing it. This uploads the file and renders an inline preview or download
card in the chat. Without this step, the file exists in the sandbox but the user
cannot see it.

Always call `create_artifact` for: `.html`, `.svg`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.md`,
`.txt`, `.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`, `.xlsx`, `.docx`, `.pptx`, `.zip` — any file
the user asked to see or download.

## Python

Python 3.14 is pre-installed with common data packages (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, pdfplumber, openpyxl, etc.). To install additional packages use `uv add <package>` (preferred) or `pip install <package>`.

## Key Commands

```bash
lumera plan                            # Preview changes (dry run)
lumera apply                           # Deploy everything
lumera run scripts/seed-demo.py        # Run seed script remotely
lumera status                          # Show sync status
```
