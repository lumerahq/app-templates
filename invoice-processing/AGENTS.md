# Invoice Processing

Upload invoice documents (PDF, images), AI extracts structured data (vendor, amounts, line items, GL codes), then review and approve. Full audit trail and activity comments.

## How It Works

1. User uploads a document → `ip_invoices` record created (`status: draft`)
2. `ip_trigger_extract` hook fires on `after_create` → sets `status: processing`, queues `extract_invoice` automation
3. `extract_invoice` reads the document with `llm.extract_text()`, populates invoice fields, creates `ip_line_items`, sets `status: review`
4. `ip_create_status_comment` hook records every status change in `ip_comments`
5. User reviews extracted data, edits mistakes, approves or rejects

**Status flow:** `draft` → `processing` → `review` → `approved` / `rejected`

**Key external IDs:** `invoice-processing:extract_invoice` (automation), `invoice-processing:ip_trigger_extract` (hook)

## Lumera Concepts

A Lumera app is built from these primitives — all defined as code in `platform/`:

- **Collections** (`platform/collections/*.json`) — Data tables with typed fields. Deployed via `lumera apply`.
- **Automations** (`platform/automations/*/`) — Python scripts that run on Lumera's servers. Each has a `config.json` and `run.py`.
- **Hooks** (`platform/hooks/*.js`) — JavaScript on collection lifecycle events (`before_create`, `after_update`, etc.).
- **Agents** (`platform/agents/*/`) — AI chat agents with a `config.json` and `system_prompt.md`.
- **Webhooks** — Receive events from external services (Stripe, GitHub, etc.). Events land in `lm_event_log`; process them with hooks or automations.
- **Mailbox** — Each tenant gets an email address. Inbound emails are persisted to `lm_mailbox_messages` — use hooks to trigger automations on new mail.
- **Email** — Send transactional emails from automations via `from lumera import email`. Logged to `lm_email_logs`.

All resources use **external IDs** in the format `<app-name>:<resource-name>` (auto-derived from `package.json` name + directory/file name).

## Workflow

1. **Read skills first** — Before writing automations, hooks, collections, or agents, read the matching skill file for API details and patterns.
2. **Code is source of truth** — Edit files in `platform/`, then deploy with `lumera apply`. Don't edit in the Lumera UI.
3. **Plan before apply** — Run `lumera plan` to preview changes, then `lumera apply` to deploy.
4. **Offer to deploy** — After changing platform resources, offer to run `lumera apply`.

## Key Commands

```bash
lumera plan                            # Preview changes (dry run)
lumera apply                           # Deploy everything
lumera run scripts/seed-demo.py        # Run seed script remotely
lumera status                          # Show sync status
```
